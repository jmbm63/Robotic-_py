Advanced Robotics project

The program should be able to:

    . Read the camera
  
    . calculate the legos position based on a sqaure that indicates the (0,0) coordenate
  
    . calculate the lego midpoint base on the circles on top
  
    . communicate with the kuka robot different data (color, position, orientation, movement)
  
    . create interface that idicates the system what figure to mount
